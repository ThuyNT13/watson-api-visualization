=================

Because we wanted to see what fun could be had from playing with **IBM Watson API** and **D3.js**.

The App
------------

On the front-end,
- using **D3.js** to visualize the data outputted from [**Personality Insights**](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/personality-insights/)

On the back-end,
- *Node* built on *Express*
- derive linguistic analytics from text input by utilizing [**IBM Watson Personality Insights API**](https://personality-insights-demo.ng.bluemix.net)

Inspiration
- [D3 Layout Pack](https://bl.ocks.org/jiankuang/93dba6fac49222458b3b35e7c233bace)
